 * ============================================================================
 * Partial-tool_use repair subsystem — canonical design note.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Every comment block elsewhere in this file that mentions one of the
 * concepts below points back here. Per-site comments should be one or two
 * lines stating WHAT the local code does; the WHY lives here.
 *
 * --- The wedge ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Anthropic-compatible backends (Anthropic, DeepSeek, …) reject a request
 * whose `user[tool_result]` blocks are not at the HEAD of the user message
 * immediately following the `model[tool_use]` they answer:
 *
 *     "tool_use_id ... must have a corresponding tool_use block in the
 *      previous message"
 *
 * Without a matching pair the session is unrecoverable — `stripOrphanedUser
 * EntriesFromHistory` only strips trailing user entries, so a lost tool_use
 * cannot be resurrected and the next send 400s repeatedly.
 *
 * --- The race classes that produce dangling tool_uses --------------------
 *
 *   Race A (Ctrl+Y mid-flight): user retries before the in-flight tool
 *     finishes. The scheduler's `onAllToolCallsComplete` is single-shot
 *     per batch and would otherwise leave the tool stuck in
 *     `completed-but-not-submitted` forever.
 *   Race B (process crash / OOM mid-flight): the JSONL transcript captures
 *     the dangling `model[fc]` and `--resume` rehydrates it.
 *   Race C (network drop between `content_block_stop` of a tool_use and
 *     the terminal `message_stop`): `processStreamResponse` re-throws
 *     after we have already yielded a `functionCall` chunk, so the React
 *     scheduler is on its way to submit a real `functionResponse` while
 *     in-memory history has no matching `model[fc]`.
 *
 * --- The two-layer fix ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   (1) Persist the partial assistant turn at the failure point in
 *       `processStreamResponse` (`this.history.push({role: 'model', parts:
 *       [...]})` plus the `pendingPartialAssistantTurnIndex` /
 *       `pendingPartialAssistantRecord` markers) so the matching
 *       `model[fc]` is on disk and in memory when the late `user[fr]`
 *       arrives.
 *   (2) Repair any remaining dangling `model[fc]` whose
 *       `user[fr]` never landed (`repairOrphanedToolUseTurns`):
 *         - SYNTHESIZE an `error` fr for ids with no matching response;
 *         - HOIST the real fr into the immediately-adjacent user turn
 *           when it landed in a non-adjacent later turn;
 *         - DROP duplicate fr copies for the same id.
 *       Then `useGeminiStream.handleCompletedTools` dedupes the
 *       scheduler's late real result against `chat.history` so the
 *       synthetic and the real result never collide on the wire.
 *
 * --- Partial-push marker lifecycle ---------------------------------------
 *
 * Set together on (streamError + hasToolCall + hasContent) inside
 * `processStreamResponse`. Cleared together by `popPartialIfPushed` on a
 * retryable error rollback, or flushed together to JSONL by the outer
 * `finally` after the retry loop exits. Defense-in-depth: every
 * history-mutation method (clearHistory / addHistory / setHistory /
 * truncateHistory / stripThoughtsFromHistory /
 * stripOrphanedUserEntriesFromHistory) resets both markers in lockstep so
 * a stale index can't shift onto an unrelated model turn and cause
 * `popPartialIfPushed` to splice the wrong entry. Any single-field reset
 * is a bug.
 * ============================================================================
 */

/**
 * Walk `history` left-to-right and close every dangling
 * tool_use ↔ tool_result pair. For each `model[functionCall]`:
 *  - SYNTHESIZE an `error` `functionResponse` for ids with no match;
 *  - HOIST a real fr from a non-adjacent later user turn into the
 *    adjacent one;
 *  - drop duplicate fr copies for the same id.
 *
 * Mutates `history` in place. Returns the synthesized (callId, name)
 * pairs so the React scheduler's dedup can drop late real results for
 * those ids; hoisted ids are NOT returned (the real fr is still in
